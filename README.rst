Description
-----------

**ModestPy** facilitates parameter estimation in models compliant with
`Functional Mock-up Interface <https://fmi-standard.org/>`__.

Features:

- combination of global and local search methods (genetic algorithm, pattern search, truncated Newton method, L-BFGS-B, sequential least squares),
- suitable also for non-continuous and non-differentiable models,
- scalable to multiple cores (genetic algorithm from `modestga <https://github.com/krzysztofarendt/modestga>`_),
- Python 3.

**Due to time constraints, Modestpy is no longer actively developed. The last system known to work well was Ubuntu 18.04.** 
Unit tests in GitHub Actions are run on Ubuntu 18.04 and Python 3.6/3.7.
It does not mean it will not work on other systems, but it is not guaranteed.
Use Docker (as described below) if you want to run ModestPy on a tested platform.

Installation with pip (recommended)
-----------------------------------

It is now possible install ModestPy with a single command:

::

    pip install modestpy

Alternatively:

::

    pip install https://github.com/sdu-cfei/modest-py/archive/master.zip

Installation with conda
-----------------------

Conda is installation is less frequently tested, but should work:

::

   conda config --add channels conda-forge
   conda install modestpy

Docker
------------

**Due to time constraints, Modestpy is no longer actively developed.
The last system known to work well was Ubuntu 18.04.**
If you encounter any issues with running ModestPy on your system (e.g. some libs missing), try using Docker.

I prepared a ``Dockerfile`` and some initial ``make`` commands:

- ``make build`` - build an image with ModestPy, based on Ubuntu 18.04 (tag = ``modestpy``)
- ``make run`` - run the container (name = ``modestpy_container``)
- ``make test`` - run unit tests in the running container and print output to terminal
- ``make bash`` - run Bash in the running container

Most likely you will like to modify ``Dockerfile`` and ``Makefile`` to your needs, e.g. by adding bind volumes with your FMUs.

Test your installation
----------------------

The unit tests will work only if you installed ModestPy with conda or cloned the project from GitHub. To run tests:

.. code:: python

    >>> from modestpy.test import run
    >>> run.tests()

or

::

    cd <project_directory>
    python ./bin/test.py


Usage
-----

Users are supposed to call only the high level API included in
``modestpy.Estimation``. The API is fully discussed in the `docs <docs/documentation.md>`__.
You can also check out this `simple example </examples/simple>`__.
The basic usage is as follows:

.. code:: python

    from modestpy import Estimation

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        session = Estimation(workdir, fmu_path, inp, known, est, ideal)
        estimates = session.estimate()
        err, res = session.validate()

More control is possible via optional arguments, as discussed in the `documentation
<docs/documentation.md>`__.

The ``if __name__ == "__main__":`` wrapper is needed on Windows, because ``modestpy``
relies on ``multiprocessing``. You can find more explanation on why this is needed
`here <https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing-programming>`__.

``modestpy`` automatically saves results in the working
directory including csv files with estimates and some useful plots,
e.g.:

1) Error evolution in combined GA+PS estimation (dots represent switch
   from GA to PS): |Error-evolution|

2) Visualization of GA evolution: |GA-evolution|

3) Scatter matrix plot for interdependencies between parameters:
   |Intedependencies|
